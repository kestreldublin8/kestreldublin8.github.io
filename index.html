    <h1>Kestrel Building Residents </h1>
    <h2>Noise Issue 2021</h2>
    
    <p>Hi all!<br> 
       Hoping for some help here.</p> 
      
    <p>For the last few months myself and other residents across multiple floors in the Kestrel Building have been experiencing a problem with a significant and persistent noise. <br>
      It sounds like someone is jumping on/hitting the floors/walls above but it could be an issue with pipes/vents. It has been occurring basically 7 days a week and at all hours. Usually lasting for 45min-1 hour sessions.
      Most frequently around 8am-9am, lunchtime, and various times between 6pm and midnight. (Although there has been multiple 1 am, 5 am and 7 am instances too.)
    </p>
    
    <p> After significant effort, no one has yet been able to figure out the source of the noise. And at this stage, multiple residents are at the point of needing to move out, despite wishing to stay.<br>
      In a final effort to get to the bottom of this, some of us want to approach management as a group to make it clear that we are all experiencing the same problem and not separate issues. 
      <br>
      So it would be super helpful if you could have a listen to the videos below to see if you have heard the same thing, and then either fill out the form or reach out to <a href="mailto:kestreldublin8@gmail.com">kestreldublin8@gmail.com</a> , sharing as much information as you would like to provide.
    </p>
    
    <p>There has been some speculation that it could be the result of someone using exercise equipment in their apartment since the gyms closed at the end of last year, and that they are unaware that it can be heard through the whole building.<br> 
       So if you think the noise in the video or the times described suggest it could be the result of something you are doing in your apartment, we would really appreciate it if you could reach out to <a href="mailto:kestreldublin8@gmail.com">kestreldublin8@gmail.com</a> so that we can test that theory and rule it out.
       (I would be happy to personally pay for gym mats if this turns out to be the root of the noise).
       <br>

    <h3>Examples of the Noise</h3>
    <p>The noise is pure bass, so you will need headphones or decent speakers in order to hear it correctly in the videos. You won't hear it through a phone's speaker. <br>
      If you are struggling to hear it, please try different headphones. Its very clear otherwise.<br>
      (I'm happy to drop a suitable pair of headphones to anyone in the building who cannot hear the noise. Just mail <a href="mailto:kestreldublin8@gmail.com">kestreldublin8@gmail.com</a>)</p>
