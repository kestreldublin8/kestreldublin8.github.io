    <h1>Kestrel Building Residents </h1>
    <h2>Noise Issue 2021</h2>
    
    <p>Hi all! Hoping for some help here.</p> 
      
    <p>Since the start of the year myself and other residents across multiple floors in the Kestrel Building have been experiencing a problem with a significant and persistent noise. 
      It sounds like someone is jumping/pounding on the floors/walls above but it could be an issue with pipes/vents. It has been occurring 7 days a week and at all hours. 
      Most frequently, 8am-9am, lunchtime, and between 9pm and midnight. (Although there has been multiple 1 am, 5 am and 7 am instances too.) </p>
      
    <p> After significant effort, no one has yet been able to figure out the source of the noise. And at this stage multiple residents are at the point of needing to move out despite wishing to stay.
    
      In a final effort to get to the bottom of this, some of us want to approach management as a group to make it clear that we are all experiencing the same problem and not separate issues. 
      So it would be super helpful if you could fill out the below form or reach out to <a href="mailto:kestreldublin8@gmail.com">kestreldublin8@gmail.com</a> , with as much information as you would like to provide.
    </p>

    <p>There has been some speculation that it could be the result of someone using gym equipment in their apartment since the gyms closed, who is unaware that it can be heard through the whole building. 
       So if you think the noise in the video or the times described could be the result of your your something you are doing in the apartment we would really appreciate it if you could reach out to <a href="mailto:kestreldublin8@gmail.com">kestreldublin8@gmail.com</a> so we can arrange to test the theory.
      I would be happy to personally pay for gym mats if this was the root of the noise.</p>

    <h3>Examples of the Noise</h3>
    <p>The noise is pure bass, so will need headphones in order to hear it correctly.</p>
